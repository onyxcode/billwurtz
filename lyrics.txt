everybody needs a second chance
each day you can make somebody new feel great
and you can change

the future song

i have a bike
and i ride it around town
seeing all the beautiful things in my neighborhood
listening to the breeze as it rolls out to sea
i wish that i could take you there with me
time ticks by as i close my eyes and dream

oh, the 70's are dead and gone
and the 80's were just a waste of new game shows
then you and i was born and we wanted something more
and it's time for us to shine
and it's time to make things right

oh, i live in silence and watch the clouds roll by and
try to make sense of each passing day
though i'm not alone, i still
feel all alone, as i'm
living in this lonely country

oh, in 1989 things changed,
and the world realized it's okay to turn the page
but what does that mean,
and does it involve me?
cuz it's time for us to shine
and it's time to make things right

[synth solo]


i am a mime, and i live inside a box
but you know that the walls isn't really there
one day i'll escape like the ghost of kurt cobain
and i'll sing about the way it used to be
life goes by as i look to the sky and scream

oh it's been about 100 years
since we all began hurriedly doing our thing
and we were almost there in the 60's but there was just
one thing left do do
'twas to give birth to me and you
oh, the 70's are dead and gone
and the 80's was just a waste of terrible news
then you and i was born, and we wanted something more
and it's time for us to shine
and it's time to make things right

the trees (okay, alright)

i like the sun
i like the sun
i like how the grass grows green
and i like the way everything sings to me
come down, come down
why don't you come down
i like the trees
and i like tripping
we're smoking marijuana
thinking bout mary ganja

politics as usual reflect the things you do
baby that's okay
baby that's alright
if love is really anything
then it's got to be everything
then it's got to be everything

i like red and green lights
they take me from my homes
they follow me like monsters
til i get things done
they beg and they plead with me
they beg and they plead with me
they beg and they plead with me
and they keep begging, and they say

elevators change the way we view the ups and downs
baby that's okay
lovely that's alright
if there is anything you need
then you got to know how to dream
then you got to know how to come clean

i like the breeze
i like the bees' knees
(dig it)
i like them bushes and breezy things
i like the way that things feel to me

we're smoking marijuana
we're smoking pot
cause this is fun and that's all we got

politics as usual reflect the things you do
baby that's alright
baby that's just fine
if love is really anything
then it's got to be everything
then it's got to be everything




sickness as usual

sickness as usual


mcdonald's

mcdonald's is a great place to think
mcdonald's is a great place to think
there's nothing like hearing the sound of
poisonous chemicals in the morning
as you drink your terrible coffee
and try to think




fly away

fly away
drive away
hide away, fly away




my penis

modern woes

there's a large penis statue
in the middle of town
there's a large penis statue in the middle of town

it's got germs on it it's got monkeys on it
it's got evil on it it's got rabies on it
and there's devils and children standing all around
and there's devils and children standing all around it

haven't you heard the news?
haven't you heard the truth?
and i hope you do
it's appalling
it's enthralling
it's unnerving
and subservient
and it's curious


we're gonna fall in love
we're gonna fall in love


rabbits make their way from A to B
rabbits don't care what they eat
rabbits don't know what they see
rabbits don't pretend to need advice from trees
or advice from me
people riding in cars like to show the world how much they care about it
by rolling over its surfaces
people paying their taxes like to include more
just in case they didn't pay enough

there's no control over the marketplace
there's no control over the price of things
there's no control over the things you do
and there's no good way to explain the truth

what do i got to do to complete this picture i've been painting
about fun, love, jazz, joy, and freedom? what do i have to do to get you hatchback driving nanny lesbians to truly feel it?
maybe i'll jump in a river
just to clear my head
maybe i'll wave a flag in front of a bull and paint it red
maybe i'll jump over a field
maybe i'll crawl under the sky
maybe i'll hide under a mountain and adjust my tie
i'm on the phone

i'm on the phone, phone
and i'm all alone, lone
see i'm on my own, own
cause i've got no home

i've got no clothes, clothes
that i can put on, on
this is how i know, know
that my hope is gone


there's a large penis statue
in the middle of town
cause i know that all hope is gone



eat bread (feel sure)

every day i eat bread
every day i eat bread
and it makes me feel so god damn right
i think i'll just sit in my bed
that don't bother me
it don't bother me & my head

every day i try to fly a plane
that don't mean i'm getting older
i'm getting closer
every day i try to make things right
that's the reason i explode here
trying to get things right


you don't have to try
you don't have to say goodbye
you don't have to listen
you just have to feel sure


every day i get crazy
every day i get green
and i think about the things that i
think that i'd like to think
and it makes me feel alright
just to sit alone and get high

every day i try to make lightning strike
at every different angle
at each and every moment
every day i try to close my eyes
and feel all the things that i feel inside


you don't have to lie
you don't have to make it right
you just have to listen
to your imagination

[instrumental break]


every day i try to do all the things that i'm supposed to do
all at the same time cause time is running out
maybe one day all be able to stop time and think things through


you don't have to try
you don't have to say goodbye
you don't have to listen
you just have to feel sure

You don't have to try.
you don't have to tell your friend goodbye
you just have to make sure
you remember how to do this
we ain't gotta say much
you've just gotta mean it

or do you think you're gonna get hungry

telling you why everything feels incomplete


things are not quite right
oh, things are not quite cool
oh, things are not quite good
oh, things are not quite cool

the song song

yo
this is a studio
metropolitan avenue at lorimer street, yeah
sunny day


well i got three months to write a song
to write a song for you
and i'm gonna take my time and say
exactly what i mean

damn, it seems like writing songs is
a lot like being in prison
then i realize that the only one who
put me there is me


got to break free
i need to break free
but i always change my mind again
and then i'm left behind
oh i wish that i could make up my mind this time
but my brain is still in black and white

oh i think i've used this melody
one thousand times before
and the worst part is that i'm not sure
if i'm the one who wrote it
i probably stole it from some song
my mommy used to sing me
or maybe it's just something
off the radio or t.v.

i got to break free
i need to break free
cause i cannot take the pain of
being locked up this way
one day you'll find me in paradise
i'll be saying what i need to say


one more time

say anything you want, and just
do anything you mean
do anything you mean
anything you need to
do anything you need
do anything you mean
please, please

got to break free
i've so got to breathe
but i always lose my mind
and then i'm standing in line
i can't remember the last time i
truly said what was on my mind
and i don't mean to waste your time
i wish that i could truly break free some time
but freedom is hard to find

freedom's hard to find
baby i'm trying
baby i think i'm dying


stuck in a rut

i'm stuck in a rut
